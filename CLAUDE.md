## Development Setup

_To be documented once the tech stack and dependencies are established._

## Build & Run Commands

_To be documented once build tooling is configured._

## Testing

_To be documented once a test framework is chosen._

## Code Conventions

- Write clear, concise code with meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior

## Git Workflow

- **Branch naming:** Feature branches use the format `claude/<description>-<session-id>`
- **Commits:** Use clear, descriptive commit messages summarizing the "why" not just the "what"
- **Push:** Always use `git push -u origin <branch-name>`

## AI Assistant Guidelines

- Read existing code before proposing changes
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Do not add unnecessary abstractions, comments, or error handling
- Keep changes minimal and focused on what was requested
- Run tests and linting (when available) before committing
